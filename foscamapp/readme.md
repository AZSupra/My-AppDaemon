version 1 is only for the new type foscam cameras.
I am working on version 2 which also has support for older types.

points i am working on:
1) better feedback for known problems (if the cam is busy, some functions dont work for a short moment)
2) implementing older cam types.
3) reparing some small problems
4) Dashboard for HAdashboard.

expected time: end of June.

to use this version:
- install Appdaemon (if you havent already)
- place the foscam.py in your Appdirectory
- edit the appdaemon.cfg with the parts i provided in appdaemon.cfg
- edit your HomeAssistant YAML files and add the things you find in the YAML file i provided.
